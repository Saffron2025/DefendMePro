        <h2>üß† Why Behavior Lockdown Beats Waiting for Patches</h2>
        <p>
          Patches are essential‚Äîbut they‚Äôre reactive. Zero-day actors hit before CVEs go public
          and long before signatures arrive. A behavior-first model prevents unknown payloads from
          gaining the privileges they need to detonate. Even if a doc opens and a script spawns,
          containment rules and child-process policies keep the blast radius near-zero.
        </p>
        <p>
          For power users and IT teams, DefendMePro offers progressive hardening: start with guided
          prompts, review what would be blocked, and tighten over time. Developers and admins can
          allow-list trusted toolchains without weakening guardrails for everything else.
